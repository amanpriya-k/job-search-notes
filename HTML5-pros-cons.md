# HTML5 Benefits

### Accessibility
- Semantic tags make reading code and rendering it much easier, like `<header>` and `<nav>`
- ARIA is a W3C spec that is mainly used to assign specific “roles” to elements in an HTML document – essentially creating important landmarks on the page: header, footer, navigation or article, via role attributes.

### Video and Audio Support
- Previously people would have to use `<embed>`and `<object>` tags
- `<audio>` and `<video>` tags make it so much easier, by treating them just like `<img>` tags have src attributes. 

### DOCTYPE

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`

- That's all you have to put at the top instead of all the other long stuff.

### Cleaner Code

- The semantic tags allow for more readable, cleaner code.

### Smarter Storage
