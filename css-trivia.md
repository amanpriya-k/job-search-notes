  # CSS Trivia

  ### 19. what does float do?
  - text comes and is bumped up next to div on side specified
  - to clear it -> clearboth, clearfix

  ### 20. what are pseudo selectors?
  - things like `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, etc.
  
  ### 21. different types of CSS positions?
  - `absolute` - positioned relative to nearest relatively positioned ancestor
  - `fixed` - positioned relative to window
  - `relative` - for parents of position absolute
  - `static` - default
  - `sticky` - for something that stays on page when scrolling

  ### 22. difference between inline, inline-block, and block?
  - `inline`: put things on same line unless they fit - doesn't break the flow
  - `block`: breaks the flow and doesn't sit inline
  - `inline-block`: similar to inline, goes with flow but takes height and width

  ### 23. are CSS properties case-sensetive?
  - no! lol
