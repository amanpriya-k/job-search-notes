# HTML5 Benefits

### Accessibility
- Semantic tags make reading code and rendering it much easier, like `<header>` and `<nav>`
- ARIA is a W3C spec that is mainly used to assign specific “roles” to elements in an HTML document – essentially creating important landmarks on the page: header, footer, navigation or article, via role attributes.

### Video and Audio Support
- Previously people would have to use `<embed>`and `<object>` tags
- `<audio>` and `<video>` tags make it so much easier, by treating them just like `<img>` tags have src attributes. 

### DOCTYPE

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`

- That's all you have to put at the top instead of all the other long stuff.

### Cleaner Code

- The semantic tags allow for more readable, cleaner code.

### Smarter Storage

- HTML5 has this feature called localStorage: it’s a little bit of a cross between regular old cookies and a client-side database. 
  - allows for storage across multiple windows
  - has better security and performance and data will persist even after the browser is closed
  - allows you to do things like storing user information, the ability to cache data, and the ability to load the user’s previous application state

### Better Interactions
- the `<canvas>` feature allows for cool animations and stuff
- here’s a quick list of native APIs:
  - Drag and Drop (DnD)
  - Offline storage database
  - Browser history management
  - document editing
  - Timed media playback

### Mobile Adaptability
- Viewport: allows you to define viewport widths and zoom settings
- Full screen browsing: IOS specific values that allow Apple devices to display in full screen mode
- Home Screen Icons: like favicons on desktop, these icons are used to add favorites to the home screen of an IOS and Android mobile device
